I have a significant amount of an Amazon gift card balance on this account, and I need access to these funds immediately. Under the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009, gift cards have to be good for at least five years from the purchase date. The Act's rules on gift cards also limited dormancy fees, banning them in the first year. You know that is not legal to lock my account with funds inside. For clarity, your company is breaking 123 STAT. 1752 (C) (I-IV). There are other examples and technicalities that I can find, but I hope to resolve this with you and to avoid contacting the Federal Trade Commission or file a complaint with my state Attorney General; need be I will. I think you understand what I am saying, and this is a little misunderstanding.\nRegards,\n(insert name here)\n```\nAccount will be unlocked and they'll apologize for, i dont know, being a dick?","stamp":1532607913050,"attach":null,"day":17738,"edited":true}],["472016541135798272",{"mid":"472016541135798272","uid":"436660351254265856","content":"`How to unlock your amazon account (method one of three)`\nJust copy and paste this block of text in an email.
